        <h1>Git-Will-Hunting</h1>

        <p>
            I chose this name for my GitHub account because it is an amusing pun and I can identify with the journey of the character. 
            At the outset of my journey I had no formal education in computer science or software engineering. My path takes me down a 
            road of self-education and I am learning to code through online resources and self-study.

        <h1>My Journey to Development</h1>
        <p> My name is William and I decided to make a major shift in my career trajectory in 2020 when I realized that the jobs
            I was working would only lead to working for other people and I would never be creating something of my own. Then I 
            decided that I would switch to a career in tech. Starting as a support advisor I learned some basic html, css, and SQL 
            and this encouraged me to learn more. I wanted both professional growth and to learn to create something of my own and so 
            I decided to learn how to code. Initially I dabbled in C++, python and later chose to follow The Odin Project curriculum.
            I have learned HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ruby, SQL, and will be learning Ruby on Rails and React.

        <h1>My Interests</h1>
        <p>
            As a child I was always fascinated with game development but it felt out of reach. Now as an adult I see that most of the 
            starter projects are to create simple games. This would have been a great starting point as a child but hindsight is 
            always 20/20. I am also interested in the advancements of AI and machine learning, yet I remain hopeful that I will not be 
            replaced by a robot.
